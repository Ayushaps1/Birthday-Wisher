# Birthday-Wisher
I have created this Birthday Wisher python program that will wish my friends and whoever i want happy birthday automatically.

**I used:-**
1. DateTime module
2. smtplib module
3. Pandas 
4. random module
5. [Pythonanywhere](www.pythonanywhere.com)

**DateTime Modlue :-** We can use this module to get the informations like current date, month, year, time<br />
**smtplib Module  :-** With the help of this module we can send mails with the help of python code<br />
**Pandas          :-** Pandas is the most popular python data analysis module<br />
**Random module   :-** We can use this module to add randomness in our program<br />
**pythonanywhere  :-** This is a very helpful website in which you can schedule your program to run every single day automatically at a time of your choosing
